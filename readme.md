Project Overview
This fully responsive blog website is built using core front-end technologies: HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It serves as a dynamic platform for publishing articles, personal thoughts, tutorials, or professional insights. The design focuses on user experience, readability, and interactivity, ensuring smooth navigation across all devices.

Key Features
1. Responsive & Modern Design

  >Each post includes:

  > Title, author, date, and category tags.

  > Featured images with hover effects.

3. Interactive User Interface

  > Smooth animations & transitions (CSS keyframes, hover effects).

  > Dark/Light Mode Toggle – Users can switch between themes (saved in localStorage).

  > Search Functionality – Filters posts based on keywords.

  
  > Category Filtering – Users can sort posts by tags (e.g., "Tech," "Travel," "Lifestyle").

Technical Implementation:-

1. HTML5 → Semantic markup for better SEO and readability.

2. CSS3 → Custom styling, animations, and responsive layouts.

3. JavaScript (ES6+) → DOM manipulation, event handling, dynamic content   loading.

Performance Optimizations

1. Lazy loading for images to improve page speed.

2. Minified CSS & JS for faster load times.

3. LocalStorage to remember user preferences (e.g., dark mode).
